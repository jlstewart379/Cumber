    <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> The version of Version 5.0.2 currently has a bug in regards to UIAStaticText fields. The value displayed on the screen is over ridden by the accessibility label. If no accessibility label is provided then the value can not be obtained. To display the value you must assign the the value of each label text to the accessibility label or link them by importing UILabel+CumberExtension.m and UILabel+CumberExtension.h</p>
        <p>Setup Pending (The project isn't ready yet)</p>
